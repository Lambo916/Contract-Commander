AGENT: UI CLEANUP + SAVE/EXPORT UX — BizPlan Builder (no code details, just implement)

GOAL
Make the bottom action area clean, consistent, and brand-aligned. Keep a minimal, always-visible toolbar. Ensure users can name files on Save As. Add proper loading state on the Generate Plan button (not inside the results panel).

A) TOOLBAR (ALWAYS VISIBLE, ABOVE RESULTS CARD)
Show these, left→right:
1) File ▾
2) Export ▾
3) Clear (button)
4) (Optional) Help ▾  — move “Version History” here or into File (see below)

• Remove any extra/duplicate buttons or labels currently shown in the results area.
• Ensure this toolbar is sticky on mobile so it stays visible at the top of the results card.

B) FILE MENU (FUNCTIONAL, NO CODE SHOWN)
File ▾ items (in order):
- New Plan  — clears inputs + results after confirm
- Open…     — open previously saved plan (list modal with search)
- Save      — saves current plan (silent)
- Save As…  — open modal to name the plan before saving (see C)
- Rename…   — rename current file (modal)
- Version History… — shows prior saves for this plan
- Move to Trash… — soft delete (with confirm)

C) “SAVE AS” / “RENAME” MODAL (REQUIRED)
• Single text field pre-filled with suggested name: `{CompanyName or Untitled} – BizPlan – {YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm}`.
• User can edit before saving.
• Show small helper line with example and where it will be stored.
• On success: toast “Saved as <name>”.
• If autosave is enabled, keep it, but still allow Save As to create a new named copy (do NOT overwrite).
• Ensure the selected name propagates to:
  - File menu current name
  - PDF/Markdown default export filenames
  - In-app header “Results – <name>” (small, subtle)

D) EXPORT MENU
Export ▾ items (match other toolkits):
- Download PDF
- Download Markdown (.md)
- Copy Markdown to Clipboard

• Do NOT hide Export before a generation. If there’s no current result, Export should prompt: “No content yet. Open a saved plan or Generate first.” (with quick links).

E) CLEAR BUTTON
• Label: “Clear”
• One-line confirm: “Clear inputs and results?” [Cancel] [Clear]
• If a file has unsaved changes, show a warning and offer Save first.

F) GENERATE PLAN BUTTON
• Primary style, consistent with brand.
• Loading behavior:
  - While generating: disable toolbar actions except “Cancel” (if supported) and show button state “Generating…” with a spinner inside the button.
  - Do NOT show “Loading” text inside the results panel.
  - Re-enable actions on completion or failure.

G) RESULTS PANEL POLISH
• Keep the results card clean and brand-consistent (same spacing, radii, divider styles as other toolkits).
• Above the results, show a tiny metadata line: `Company: <name>  •  Stage: <stage>  •  Generated: <timestamp>`
• Below metadata, keep sections in this order (only if present): Executive Snapshot → Executive Summary → Market Analysis → Business Model → Go-to-Market Strategy → Product Roadmap → Financial Outlook → Risk Mitigation → Next Steps → KPI Table → AI Insights.
• Ensure KPI table styling and AI Insights box match the in-app look (no extra borders/noise).

H) FOOTERS / DISCLAIMERS
• App footer (homepage and tool page): first line centered with clickable “YourBizGuru.com”, then centered links “Privacy” • “Terms” on the same line; second line is the standard disclaimer. Keep all centered.
• PDF footer (each page): left-aligned two lines:
  Line 1: “Powered by YourBizGuru.com”
  —thin divider line—
  Line 2: Standard disclaimer text (unchanged).
• Do not change fonts/colors beyond current theme.

I) ACCESSIBILITY & MOBILE
• Hit targets ≥ 44px on touch.
• Ensure toolbar wraps gracefully on small screens (two rows if needed).
• Keep focus states visible; preserve keyboard navigation.

J) STATE & ERRORS
• Disable Export/Clear/New/Open while “Generating…” (except if safe).
• Non-blocking toasts for success/error (top-right).
• If a plan is unsaved and user navigates away (New/Open/Clear), prompt to Save/Discard.

K) CONSISTENCY
• Use the same button sizes, weights, and spacing scale as the other toolkits (GrantGenie, CompliPilot, Elev8 Analyzer).
• Ensure iconography (if any) is consistent across menus.

Please implement all of the above. When done, verify:
- “Save As” actually lets me name a new file and that name drives default export filenames.
- Toolbar is always visible (even before any generation) and looks the same on mobile and desktop.
- “Generating…” state appears only on the Generate Plan button and returns to normal afterward.
- PDF footer uses two lines with a divider between them, as specified.
