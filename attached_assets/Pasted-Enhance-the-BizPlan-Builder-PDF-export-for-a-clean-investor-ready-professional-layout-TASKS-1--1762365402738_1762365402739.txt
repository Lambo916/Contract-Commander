Enhance the BizPlan Builder PDF export for a clean, investor-ready, professional layout.

TASKS:
1. **Chart Rendering Fix**
   - Capture all visible Chart.js canvases with html2canvas before jsPDF export.
   - Use {scale: 2, useCORS: true} for crisp vector-like rendering.
   - Wait for chart animations to complete (use await or onRenderComplete) before capture.

2. **Unified Layout & Margins**
   - Apply consistent 20 px left/right and 25 px top/bottom page padding globally.
   - Align all section text blocks uniformly and maintain equal spacing between headers and body text.

3. **Visual Hierarchy / Dividers**
   - Slim yellow divider lines by ≈ 15 %.
   - Keep consistent 10 px top and 15 px bottom spacing around every divider.
   - Use brand accent color #FFEB3B for light theme or #4DB6E7 for dark theme.

4. **Typography & Branding**
   - Use the same sans-serif font across all sections.
   - Section headers: font-weight 600, size 14 pt.
   - Body text: font-weight 400, size 11 pt.
   - Optional: apply #4DB6E7 header accent underline for YourBizGuru brand consistency.

5. **Duplicate Section Cleanup**
   - Merge all “KPI Visualization” duplicates into a single KPI section containing the table and chart together.
   - Remove redundant line “Generated insights provided by YourBizGuru AI” (footer already covers attribution).

6. **Financial & AI Panels**
   - Ensure Financial Summary and AI Insights export with matching light background color.
   - Capture them via html2canvas before conversion to maintain visual fidelity.

7. **Optional Summary Dashboard Page**
   - After Executive Summary, insert a new summary page titled “Financial Snapshot.”
   - Display the three main charts (Revenue, Expense, Profit) side-by-side or stacked evenly with captions.

8. **Table of Contents (TOC)**
   - Automatically generate a TOC on page 1 that lists each major section (Executive Snapshot, Executive Summary, Market Analysis, Business Model, Go-To-Market Strategy, Product Roadmap, Financial Outlook, KPI Visualization, AI Insights).
   - Include section titles only (no page numbers required).
   - Add a subtle horizontal divider below the TOC for a clean separation before the main content.

9. **Header & Footer Consistency**
   - Add repeating page header “BizPlan Builder | YourBizGuru.com” (top left).
   - Keep footer “Powered by YourBizGuru.com    For informational purposes only. Not legal, tax, or financial advice.” on every page.
   - Auto-number pages (e.g., “Page 2 of 6”) aligned bottom-right.

10. **Export Fidelity**
    - Use jsPDF autoTable for any tabular data (KPI, Financial Summary) to ensure line alignment.
    - Set jsPDF margins = {top: 25, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 25}.
    - Enable compression to reduce PDF size without quality loss.

11. **Final Polish & Testing**
    - Verify all text blocks, tables, and charts fit within page margins (no clipping).
    - Test in both light and dark modes.
    - Final export filename format:  
      `BizPlanBuilder_[CompanyName]_YYYYMMDD.pdf`
    - Confirm result appears consistent, balanced, and professional — ready for investor presentation.
