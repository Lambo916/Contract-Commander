### 🧩 CONTRACT COMMANDER POLISH INSTRUCTIONS (FINAL)

**Objective:**  
Clean and finalize both the **app footer** and **PDF export layout** for production use.

---

#### 🧱 1. WEB APP FOOTER (Frontend)
- **Remove duplicate footer**: Keep only the very bottom section that includes:  
  > “Powered by YourBizGuru.com | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service”  
  > and the single legal disclaimer line underneath it.  
- Delete the extra mid-page or repeating footer blocks completely.  
- Ensure the remaining footer has consistent spacing (padding-top: 40px; padding-bottom: 40px).  
- Background: subtle light gray (#f8f9fa) or match app background for seamless integration.  
- Text alignment: centered, font-size 12-13px, color #6c757d.  
- Include one link hover effect (slightly darker gray).  

✅ Result: Clean, single footer at page bottom — professional and minimal.

#### 🧾 2. PDF EXPORT CLEANUP
**Goal:** Remove redundancy and tighten layout spacing.

**Changes:**
1. **Keep footer only on last page.**
   - Remove duplicate “Generated by Contract Commander / Powered by YourBizGuru.com / Legal Notice” on all previous pages.  
   - Footer on last page should read exactly:
     ```
     Generated by Contract Commander | Powered by https://YourBizGuru.com  
     © 2025 YourBizGuru LLC. All rights reserved.  
     Legal Notice: Documents are AI-assisted and provided for informational and drafting purposes only — not legal, tax, or financial advice. No attorney-client relationship is created. Review with a qualified professional before use.
     ```
     *Center-aligned, font size 8–9px, gray #777, no bolding.*
2. **Remove “Page x of y” from middle pages** unless required by compliance. If kept, right-align bottom margin, light gray.
3. **Tighten signature block spacing:**
   - Reduce line spacing between each element from ~25px → 10px.
   - Group each signer block visually:
     ```
     ______________________________  
     Signature (Printed Name / Title)  
     Date: _________________
     ```
   - Add small vertical gap (10–15 px) between signers.
4. **Top margin for signature section:** add 20–30 px before “IN WITNESS WHEREOF…” to separate from last paragraph cleanly.

✅ Result:  Professional contract layout, 3–4 pages max, no footer duplication, balanced white space.

---

#### 🧩 3. STYLING CONSISTENCY (GLOBAL)
- Font family: **Inter**, fallback = Arial, sans-serif.  
- Font sizes: body 12 pt, headings 14–16 pt bold.  
- Line height: 1.4–1.5 em.  
- Header alignment: left; footer = centered.  
- Margins: 0.75–1 inch all sides.

---

#### ⚖️ 4. LEGAL TEXT (APP + PDF)
- Use **one version only**, identical wording:  
  > “Documents generated by Contract Commander are for informational and drafting purposes only and do not constitute legal, tax, or financial advice. No attorney-client relationship is created.”

- Ensure it appears:
  - Once in web app footer.  
  - Once in PDF (final page footer only).

---

#### ✅ FINAL REVIEW CHECKLIST
- [ ] App shows only one footer block (no mid-page repeats).  
- [ ] PDF export shows footer on last page only.  
- [ ] Signature spacing tightened.  
- [ ] Legal disclaimer unified and consistent.  
- [ ] Typography & margins balanced.  
- [ ] All branding references correct: “Contract Commander” + “YourBizGuru.com”.

---

Once complete, run a quick test PDF with a 3-page contract to confirm:  
- Signature section alignment is compact and even.  
- Footer appears once and matches website branding exactly.  
- No double footer or redundant disclaimers.
