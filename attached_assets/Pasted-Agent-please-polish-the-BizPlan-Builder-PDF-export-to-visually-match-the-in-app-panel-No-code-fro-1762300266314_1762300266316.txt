Agent — please polish the BizPlan Builder PDF export to visually match the in-app panel. No code from me; you handle all styling and structure.

GOALS:
1. Make the PDF export reflect the same premium YBG interface design.
2. Ensure consistency between the panel and exported PDF — typography, colors, spacing, dividers, and tables.
3. Maintain clean investor-ready formatting with a plush, professional tone.

DETAILS:

🟦 EXECUTIVE SNAPSHOT
- Apply light gradient background (white → subtle light-blue hue).
- Use bold uppercase labels (COMPANY, STAGE, INDUSTRY, TARGET MARKET).
- Keep consistent spacing and clean separators between each data row.
- Title: “Executive Snapshot” with the same blue accent bar as in-app.

📊 KPI TABLE
- Recreate table formatting to mirror the in-app version.
- Use blue table header with white text for “Objective | KPI | Target | Timeframe”.
- Add alternating row shading (very light gray).
- Include a faint gold underline below the table title “Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)”.
- Retain editable logic for future use but render static cleanly in PDF (no buttons).

💡 AI INSIGHTS BOX
- Apply light yellow shaded box with a faint gold left border (mimic in-app card).
- Add a small lightbulb icon at the top-left corner (same as UI).
- Title: “AI Insights” in bold, dark-gray text.
- Maintain list bullets with clean spacing.
- Add a short footer line under this section: “Generated insights provided by YourBizGuru AI.”

🧩 LAYOUT + TYPOGRAPHY
- Use the same typography hierarchy from the UI:
  - Section headers: bold, slightly larger font
  - Body: clean, modern sans-serif (same as Elev8 Analyzer)
- Add consistent 20–25px padding per section.
- Ensure proper line spacing (1.4x–1.6x) and spacing before headers.

🪶 FOOTER + HEADER
- Keep current BizPlan Builder logo header with thin gold divider.
- Add footer: “Powered by YourBizGuru • Generated {timestamp} • For informational use only.”
- Page numbering format: “Page X of Y” aligned right.

🎨 COLOR + BRAND UNIFORMITY
- Primary colors: #4DB6E7 (light blue), #FFEB3B (accent gold), #212121 (dark gray text).
- Keep YBG branding cohesive with GrantGenie and Elev8 Analyzer.
- Apply soft shadows for main content blocks for depth.

📄 OUTPUT CHECK
- Preview and confirm:
  - KPI table alignment remains consistent across pages.
  - AI Insights box retains its background color in exported PDF.
  - No sections bleed to next page awkwardly.
  - All fonts embedded for rendering consistency.
- Ensure final output looks crisp, professional, and consistent with the live interface.

Once implemented:
✅ Confirm visual parity between the app panel and the PDF.
✅ Verify all headers, boxes, and sections retain proper spacing and styling.
✅ Ensure export maintains brand professionalism across devices and PDF readers.
