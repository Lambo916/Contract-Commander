AGENT BRIEF — PHASE 2: CLEAN-UP & REBRAND (Contract Commander)

Goal:
Rebrand the current repo (forked from BizPlan Builder) to “Contract Commander,” remove BizPlan-specific UI, and set up clean branding files without breaking the working wiring.

Constraints:
- Keep all Supabase/OpenAI wiring intact.
- Do not change server endpoints or env keys.
- Node runtime stays at 20.x (Vercel already good).

Tasks:

1) Global rename of visible copy
- Perform case-sensitive, whole-word replacements in source files (tsx/js/ts/html/md):
  - “BizPlan Builder” → “Contract Commander”
  - “BizPlan” → “Contract Commander”
  - “business plan(s)” → “contract(s)”
  - “plan” (when referring to document) → “contract” (skip occurrences in code identifiers; only update UI text and README).
- Files to include: /client, /app, /src, /pages, /components, /public, README.md.
- Exclude: node_modules, .vercel, build/output, server logic strings that refer to table names.

2) Site metadata
- Edit /client/index.html (or /app/layout.tsx head, depending on project):
  - <title>Contract Commander</title>
  - meta description: “Draft, customize, and export professional contracts (NDAs, MOUs, Service Agreements) with AI assistance. Secure, fast, and export-ready.”

3) Branding constants
- Create (or update) src/config/branding.ts with:
  export const BRAND = {
    name: "Contract Commander",
    short: "Contract Commander",
    tagline: "AI-assisted contracts in minutes.",
    primary: "#F5C543",   // gold
    dark: "#111111",
    light: "#FFFFFF",
    accent: "#C9C9D1"     // light gray
  };

4) Styles (CSS variables)
- In /public/ybg.css (or the main global stylesheet), add/update root variables:
  :root{
    --brand-primary:#F5C543;
    --brand-bg:#111111;
    --brand-text:#FFFFFF;
    --brand-muted:#C9C9D1;
  }
- Update header/footer/button classes to use these variables (no layout changes).

5) Header & footer components
- Update site logo text and tagline in the shared layout component (e.g., /components/Header.tsx and /components/Footer.tsx):
  - Header title: Contract Commander
  - Subtitle: “Create NDAs, MOUs, and Service Agreements with AI.”
  - Footer link text should reference YourBizGuru.com and Contract Commander.

6) Remove BizPlan-specific UI
- Comment out or delete components that are strictly BizPlan features:
  Likely files/folders to de-scope:
  - /components/Kpi*, /components/Financial*, /components/PricingAssumptions*
  - Any charting/metrics panels labeled “MRR”, “CAC”, “LTV”, “pitch”, “funding”
- If these components are imported into the main page, remove the imports and JSX usage.

7) Contract Commander home copy (landing panel)
- Replace the hero/intro block content with:
  H1: “Contract Commander”
  Lead: “Generate lawyer-style contracts in minutes — NDA, MOU, Service Agreement, and more.”
  Bullets:
    • Guided questions → clean clauses
    • Editable preview before export
    • Save versions to your workspace
    • PDF & DOCX export

8) Asset swap
- Add /public/contract-commander-logo.svg (simple placeholder ok).
- Point header/logo to this asset. Alt text: “Contract Commander logo”.

9) README refresh
- Overwrite README.md top section with:
  # Contract Commander
  AI-assisted contract drafting for NDAs, MOUs, Service Agreements, and more.  
  **Stack:** Next.js (or Vite) + Vercel Functions + Supabase + OpenAI.  
  **Env:** TOOL_NAME=contractcommander, PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://contract.yourbizguru.com

10) Build & smoke test
- Run project build and preview.
- Confirm: app loads, header/footer show new brand, no BizPlan panels visible, generate/export still works.
- Deliver a short changelog of files touched.

Success Criteria:
- No references to “BizPlan Builder” remain in UI/README.
- Colors/branding reflect gold/white/dark theme.
- Only contract-related panels remain.
- App compiles and runs locally in Replit and deploys cleanly on Vercel.

Output:
- List of edited/removed files
- Before/after screenshots of header + main screen
- Notes on any places where BizPlan terms were embedded in code identifiers and intentionally left unchanged to avoid breakage.
