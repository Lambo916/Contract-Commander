Please implement the BizPlan Builder UI clean-up and behavior updates as follows (no changes to fonts or colors):

1) Inputs & layout
- Keep the current title/subtitle. Add a small “Last saved” timestamp aligned to the far right of the header area.
- Use a 2-column responsive form grid (single column on narrow screens). Keep current labels but shorten where obvious (e.g., “Top Goals (6–12 mo)”).
- Show helper text only for Product/Service and Goals; remove long placeholder paragraphs elsewhere.

2) Sticky action toolbar (always visible)
- Add a sticky toolbar directly under the Tone selector with buttons: File ▾ | Export ▾ | Generate Plan | Reset Form | Help ▾
- Ensure this toolbar is visible before and after generation.
- “Reset Form” replaces “Clear All” and clears inputs + results.
- Generate Plan button shows an inline loading state (“Generating…”) with a spinner; remove the panel-level loading text.

3) File menu behavior
- File menu items: New, Open…, Save, Save As…, Rename…, Delete, Version History.
- Implement Save As… modal: filename text input (pre-filled), optional description, Confirm/Cancel. On confirm: save a new file and set it as the active document name in the UI.
- Ensure Save performs autosave of current active name. New clears the form and assigns an untitled name. Open… lists existing saved files.

4) Export menu
- Items: Download .md, Download .pdf, Copy Markdown, Copy Summary.
- Keep existing PDF engine; no style changes except parity items in section 6.

5) Meta strip above Results
- Replace the current key/value row with pill badges: Company • Industry • Stage • Generated: <timestamp>
- Clicking a pill focuses the underlying input (do not open dialogs).

6) Results panel & components
- Keep the current card style. Make each section collapsible with a caret; default: Executive Snapshot and Executive Summary expanded, others collapsed on mobile and expanded on desktop.
- KPI table: editable cells, “+ Add KPI”, and a small “Export KPIs only” action.
- AI Insights: keep the yellow callout styling; add a “Regenerate insights” button that refreshes only the insights using current inputs.

7) PDF parity (no new fonts/colors)
- Match on-screen section order/spacing in the PDF, including the KPI table layout and the AI Insights box appearance.
- Footer per page: line 1 left-aligned “Powered by YourBizGuru.com”, then a thin divider line, then line 2 left-aligned disclaimer text that we already use across YBG. Keep existing page number placement.

8) Mobile polish
- Add a bottom fixed bar containing: File ▾  Export ▾  Generate  Reset (icons + labels). Hide this bar on desktop where the sticky toolbar is visible.
- Ensure all interactive elements meet comfortable tap sizes and no content overflows.

9) Notifications & errors
- Use non-intrusive toasts for Save/Save As/Rename/Delete/Export success, and inline error messages at the control that failed.

Please implement and wire these without altering the current theme tokens or introducing new font/color choices. Keep code organized (components/utils) and preserve existing routes and API calls.
