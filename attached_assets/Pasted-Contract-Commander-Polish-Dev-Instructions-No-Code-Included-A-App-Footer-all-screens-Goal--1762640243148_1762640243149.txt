Contract Commander Polish — Dev Instructions (No Code Included)

A) App Footer (all screens)

Goal: One clean footer block, no repetition.
	1.	Remove duplicates. Keep a single footer at the very bottom. Delete any second “Powered by…” or second legal block.
	2.	Structure footer into exactly two lines:
	•	Line 1 (brand/links):
Powered by YourBizGuru.com  •  Privacy Policy  •  Terms of Service
	•	Line 2 (legal mini-notice):
Documents are AI-assisted and provided for informational and drafting purposes only — not legal, tax, or financial advice. No attorney-client relationship is created. Review with a qualified professional before use.
	3.	Design rules:
	•	Font size: Line 1 = 12–13px; Line 2 = 11–12px.
	•	Color: 60–70% gray; links use brand blue with underline on hover.
	•	Spacing: 8–10px vertical gap between Line 1 and Line 2; 24px padding above the page edge.
	•	Year auto-updates (© 2025 → auto).
	4.	Link targets:
	•	“Privacy Policy” → /privacy
	•	“Terms of Service” → /terms
	•	“Powered by” → https://YourBizGuru.com
	5.	Mobile: Center-align both lines; ensure they wrap on small screens without overlapping anything.

B) PDF Export (all contract types)

Goal: Professional output; minimal branding; legal appears once on the last page only.
	1.	Header (every page):
	•	Top-left: Contract title (e.g., Service Agreement).
	•	Top-right: Generated by Contract Commander
	•	Remove: Any URL, “Generated by…” mid-page banners, or repeating disclaimers at top.
	2.	Footer (pages 1..N-1):
	•	Left: Page {current} of {total}
	•	Right: Optional small “YourBizGuru.com”
	•	No legal text on these pages.
	3.	Footer (last page only):
	•	Stacked block with subtle divider above it:
	•	Line A (copyright): © {YEAR} YourBizGuru LLC. All rights reserved.
	•	Line B (legal notice):
Legal Notice: Contract Commander is an AI-assisted document generator. Content is for informational and drafting purposes only and does not constitute legal, tax, or financial advice. No attorney-client relationship is created. Review with a qualified professional before use.
	•	Font size: 9–10px; 50–60% gray; 16px top margin from signatures.
	4.	Remove all duplicates/overlaps you’re seeing now: delete any mid-page “Generated by…”, any second legal paragraph, and any bottom banners that repeat on every page.
	5.	Signature page polish:
	•	After “SIGNATURES” block, ensure at least 24px gap before footer.
	•	Each party block: Entity Name → By: Name → Title: → Date:. Align to a 2-column grid if two parties; 3-column if three.
	6.	Typography & spacing:
	•	Body: 11pt; headings: 13–14pt bold; section spacing = 10–12pt.
	•	Keep consistent line-height (1.35–1.45).
	7.	No watermarks. No repeating disclaimers on each page; branding stays subtle in header/footer only.
	8.	Metadata:
	•	PDF Title: {ContractType} — {ContractTitle} — {YYYY-MM-DD}
	•	Author: YourBizGuru LLC
	•	Subject: Generated by Contract Commander
	9.	File name pattern (download):
{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}_ContractCommander_{ContractType}_{CounterpartyOrProject}.pdf

C) Content Safety & Inputs
	1.	Sanitize injected titles. If a user types “Considering” in the “Contract Title”, display it only as the document title; do not echo it elsewhere (avoid weird repeats).
	2.	Fallbacks. If any optional field is blank, omit its label entirely (e.g., no lone “Title:”).

D) QA Checklist (before shipping)
