### 🧠 CONTRACT COMMANDER — WHITE-LABEL MODE IMPLEMENTATION (FINAL)

**Objective:**  
Deliver fully professional, client-ready PDF exports without visible YourBizGuru branding — while preserving hidden attribution and legal protection.

---

#### 🧩 1. DEFAULT EXPORT SETTINGS  (Client-Facing PDFs)
- **Visible Branding:** None.  
  - Remove all “Generated by Contract Commander” or “Powered by YourBizGuru.com” footers.  
  - Remove logo marks or promotional text on every page.  
- **Footer (last page only):**  
  ```
  Disclaimer: This document is generated automatically for informational and drafting purposes only and does not constitute legal, tax, or financial advice. No attorney-client relationship is created.
  ```
  - Font size: 9 px  
  - Color: #777 (medium gray)  
  - Alignment: center  
  - One light divider line above footer (#e0e0e0)  
- **Placement:** Footer appears only on the final page of each PDF.  

✅ Result → Clients receive clean, professional, unbranded contracts suitable for real business use.

---

#### 🔒 2. METADATA ATTRIBUTION (Hidden Layer)
Insert invisible identifiers within each exported PDF for ownership and compliance tracking.  
Use jsPDF or equivalent method:

| Field | Example Value |
|-------|----------------|
| Author | `YourBizGuru LLC` |
| Producer | `Contract Commander AI` |
| Copyright | `© 2025 YourBizGuru LLC All rights reserved.` |

Optional: add a 1 px transparent watermark or base64-encoded comment node at (x: 0, y: 0) for backend verification only — opacity 0.02.  

✅ Ensures traceability without user visibility.

---

#### ⚙️ 3. ADMIN TOGGLE (Optional Control)
Add admin-only setting in the dashboard:
```
[ ] Enable Visible Watermark on PDFs
```
- Default: **OFF** (white-label mode active).  
- When toggled ON → display small footer:
  > “Generated by Contract Commander | Powered by YourBizGuru.com”  
  > + standard disclaimer beneath it.

✅ Enables flexibility for demo, beta, or marketing builds.

---

#### 🧾 4. SIGNATURE BLOCK REFINEMENT
- Reduce vertical spacing between signature lines from ~25 px → 10 px.  
- Each signer block should follow:
  ```
  ______________________________  
  Signature (Printed Name / Title)  
  Date: __________________
  ```
- Add 15 px vertical gap between signers.  
- Apply consistent margin-top 30 px before “IN WITNESS WHEREOF”.

---

#### 🧱 5. GLOBAL STYLE CONSISTENCY
- Font family: **Inter**, fallback = Arial, sans-serif.  
- Font sizes: 12 pt body / 14–16 pt headings.  
- Line height: 1.4–1.5 em.  
- Margins: 1 inch top/bottom, 0.75 inch sides.  
- Header alignment = left; Footer = centered.  

---

#### ⚖️ 6. LEGAL COMPLIANCE SUMMARY
- Disclaimer always present (last page).  
- YBG attribution remains hidden in metadata.  
- Watermark optional via admin toggle.  
- No explicit claim of legal service (stays compliant with AI-assisted disclosure rules).  

---

#### ✅ FINAL QA CHECKLIST
| Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|----------------|
| Visible YBG branding removed | ✅ |
| Disclaimer visible (last page only) | ✅ |
| Metadata embedded correctly | ✅ |
| Signature spacing tightened | ✅ |
| Footer alignment + divider consistent | ✅ |
| Optional watermark toggle functional | ✅ |
