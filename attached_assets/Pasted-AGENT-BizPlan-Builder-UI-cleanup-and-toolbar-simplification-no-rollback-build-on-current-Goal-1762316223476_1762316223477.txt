AGENT: BizPlan Builder – UI cleanup and toolbar simplification (no rollback, build on current)

Goals
- Remove redundancy, use one clean command bar, and keep all metadata inside the Results panel.
- Keep existing theme/branding and current fonts/colors.

Changes to implement
1) Generate button
   - Remove the duplicate “Generate…” button. Keep ONE primary “Generate Plan” button.
   - Primary location: in the bottom command bar (sticky on mobile/desktop).
   - Button states: Idle = “Generate Plan”; Busy = “Generating…” with spinner; Disabled when required fields are missing.

2) Command bar (single row, sticky)
   - Keep exactly three dropdowns + one primary button:
     • File ▾
       – New
       – Open
       – Save
       – Save As… (PROMPT for filename before saving; do NOT autosave silently)
       – Rename… (PROMPT for new name)
       – Delete
     • Export ▾
       – PDF (uses current polished YBG PDF layout)
       – DOCX
       – Markdown
     • Tools ▾   (new)
       – Load Template… (opens modal with template list/preview)
       – Clear All (resets inputs and results with confirm)
       – Version History (open/restore previously saved versions)
     • [Primary] Generate Plan  (see #1)

   - Remove any second/legacy toolbar or floating controls below the tone selector.

3) Load Template UX
   - Move “Load Template” into Tools ▾ (remove the standalone pill button).
   - Modal includes: list with small descriptions, search/filter, and “Load” action.
   - After load, show a subtle toast “Template loaded”.

4) Metadata placement
   - Remove the separate metadata header above the Results panel.
   - Add a compact “Plan Meta” strip INSIDE the Results panel at the top (Company, Industry, Stage, Generated timestamp).
   - Keep this strip in the export as well (top of page 1 under the title block).

5) Results panel polish
   - Ensure the Results card keeps the same padding, radius, and shadows as the rest of the app.
   - No extra banners or labels outside the panel; all status messages and metadata live inside.
   - When generating, show a slim inline progress bar at the very top INSIDE the Results panel (beneath the Meta strip), not as a separate global banner.

6) Footer (app pages)
   - Keep the centered two-line footer as implemented:
     Line 1: clickable YourBizGuru.com • Privacy Policy • Terms of Service
     Line 2: disclaimer text
   - No style changes; reuse current theme.

7) Mobile behavior
   - Command bar is sticky at bottom with dropdowns collapsing properly.
   - Ensure dropdowns are full-width on small screens and don’t overflow the viewport.
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the Tone selector and the command bar.

8) Persistence
   - “Save As…” must allow custom naming at save time.
   - Persist last-used template and reopen it on next visit (if available), with an option in Tools ▾ to “Start from Blank”.

9) QA checklist
   - Verify: only one Generate button visible across all viewports.
   - Verify: Load Template appears only in Tools ▾ and the old pill is removed.
   - Verify: Metadata no longer appears above Results; instead it’s inside the panel.
   - Verify: PDF export still uses the unified YBG layout and the new Meta strip appears under the title on page 1.
   - Verify: App footer remains centered two-line; PDF footer remains left-aligned with the separator line between the two footer lines.

Please implement these UI/UX changes now without altering existing color tokens or typography.
