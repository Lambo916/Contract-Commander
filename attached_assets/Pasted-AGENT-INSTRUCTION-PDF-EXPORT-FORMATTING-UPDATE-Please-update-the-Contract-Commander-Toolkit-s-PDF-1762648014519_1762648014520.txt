AGENT INSTRUCTION — PDF EXPORT FORMATTING UPDATE

Please update the Contract Commander Toolkit’s PDF export layout to improve visual professionalism and spacing.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Make the exported PDF look polished and business-ready — similar to professional contract templates (DocuSign, PandaDoc, or Adobe Sign style).

✅ REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS:

1. **Letterhead Section (Logo + Company Info)**
   - Maintain logo’s aspect ratio (prevent any stretching or warping).
   - Reduce logo size slightly (approx. 80–100px tall).
   - Align logo and company info horizontally side-by-side or neatly stacked with balanced spacing.
   - Center or left-align entire letterhead section; whichever looks cleaner and balanced.
   - Add a thin divider line below letterhead (optional, light gray #CCCCCC) to separate it from the contract body.

2. **Body Text / Paragraph Spacing**
   - Reduce vertical spacing between paragraphs and section headers (target line-height: 1.3–1.4).
   - Reduce top/bottom page margins slightly so content flows more efficiently across pages.
   - Ensure consistent left/right padding — visually balanced but not excessive.

3. **Signature Block Formatting**
   - Tighten vertical spacing between signature lines and titles.
   - Signature section should fit within half a page (not an entire page unless content length demands it).
   - Align signature labels neatly:
     Example:
       Dff  
       By: _________________________   Date: ___________  
       Dddf, Dddf  

     (Then one line space before next signer block.)

4. **Page Break Logic**
   - Prevent awkward page breaks that leave large empty spaces.
   - Ensure section titles (e.g., “TERM AND TERMINATION”) never appear at the bottom of a page without content following them.

5. **Footer**
   - Keep current disclaimer text but reduce font size slightly (9–10pt).
   - Align footer text center or right; maintain consistent margin.

📄 GOAL:
Produce a clean, compact, and professional contract layout — readable on both desktop and mobile PDF viewers, resembling modern SaaS contract exports.

This update focuses only on styling, not logic. Please ensure all functionality (logo upload, letterhead fields, clause toggles, etc.) continues to work as before.
