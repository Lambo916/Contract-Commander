AGENT INSTRUCTION — FINAL POLISH PASS (PDF EXPORT + PRESENTATION QA)

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Apply final layout and spacing polish for Contract Commander’s PDF export to make it professional-grade and client-ready.

---

✅ REQUIRED POLISH UPDATES:

1. **Header / Letterhead**
   - Keep logo aspect ratio 100% (no stretch).
   - Align logo and company info either:
     a) Side-by-side with even vertical alignment, OR  
     b) Stacked with 10–15px spacing between logo and text.
   - Reduce logo size to ~80–100px height.
   - Add subtle divider line below header (#DDDDDD, 1px solid).
   - Slightly increase top padding (20–25px) for balance.

2. **Body Layout**
   - Reduce line height to 1.35–1.4 for compact readability.
   - Reduce section spacing: no more than 10–12px before/after headings.
   - Adjust page margins to approx. 0.6–0.75 inches all around.
   - Ensure headings (e.g., “1. PARTIES”) are bold + 1pt larger than body.

3. **Page Break Logic**
   - Prevent section titles from being orphaned at the bottom of a page.
   - Allow small content shifts to keep logical groupings together.

4. **Signature Section**
   - Tighten spacing so full signature block fits in half a page.
   - Example format:

     Dff  
     By: ______________________   Date: ___________  
     Dddf, Dddf  

     (then one line space, next signer)

   - Ensure no extra page added solely for signatures.

5. **Footer**
   - Keep disclaimer text but reduce to 9pt.
   - Center-align; add top margin ~10px for visual separation.
   - Ensure uniform distance from page edge (~0.5 inch).

6. **Visual Check**
   - Test both with and without logo uploaded.
   - Confirm layout remains balanced on A4 + US Letter sizes.
   - Verify PDF still exports cleanly via jsPDF without overflow.

🧩 OPTIONAL MICRO-POLISH (if time allows)
   - Add faint light-gray line below “Service Agreement” title.
   - Add small consistent padding (10–15px) above each section header.
   - Lighten horizontal rule under header for aesthetic balance.
